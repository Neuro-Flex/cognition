## Overview

We are building AI consciousness with in-depth research on Global Workspace Theory (GWT), Integrated Information Theory (IIT), Attention Schema Theory (AST), and Higher Order Theory (HOT). Our goal is to develop a comprehensive understanding and implementation of these theories using three different frameworks: JAX (with Optax, Flax, and DM-Haiku), PyTorch, and TensorFlow.

## Frameworks

### JAX
- **Optax**: A gradient processing and optimization library for JAX.
- **Flax**: A high-performance neural network library for JAX.
- **DM-Haiku**: A simple neural network library for JAX.

### PyTorch
- A deep learning framework that provides flexibility and speed.

### TensorFlow
- An end-to-end open-source platform for machine learning.

## Research Areas

### Global Workspace Theory (GWT)
- Focuses on the integration of information across different cognitive processes.

### Integrated Information Theory (IIT)
- Measures the level of consciousness based on the integration of information.

### Attention Schema Theory (AST)
- Explains how the brain constructs a model of attention to control and predict sensory input.

### Higher Order Theory (HOT)
- Suggests that consciousness arises from higher-order representations of sensory information.

## Goals

- Conduct an in-depth review of each theory.
- Develop implementations using JAX, PyTorch, and TensorFlow.
- Create a comprehensive framework for AI consciousness.

## Future Work

- Expand research beyond current theories.
- Develop advanced models for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) that incorporate consciousness.

## Conclusion

Understanding and implementing AI consciousness is crucial for the development of AGI. By leveraging multiple frameworks and theories, we aim to create a robust and comprehensive approach to AI consciousness research.
